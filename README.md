# Programming Finals 01

This project features a Core War-inspired game where two or more programs compete for control of the main memory. Each program consists of a series of commands 
designed to modify memory, aiming to disrupt the execution of opposing programs. A program wins the contest if it successfully prevents all others from executing further. 
The game can be configured and played via the command line.
This game was developed as the first half of the final project for the 'Programmieren' course in the Computer Science bachelor's program at KIT.
